# TRPG-Project
School Project ODA centered around creating a T-RPG and hopefully maturing it to a full 
pledged game with its very own mechanics.

ATM, the game's architecture is centered around MVC architecture pattern to handle events and GUI

List of potential design patterns :
    - Observer (inherent to MVC)
    - State to change screen with MVC
    - Factory to build entities
    - Decorator to handle buffs/debuffs
    - ECS to make creating entities more flexible
